# Imagine a right triangle:

# Read a number from the standard input and assign it to a
# Read another number from the standard input and assign it to b
# Use Pythagoras theorem to determine the value of the long side c
# Use string formatting to print out the length of the long side
# If c is larger than PI (a constant), also print out: And this is longer than PI
pi=3.14
a=float(input("input the value of side a"))
b=float(input("input the value of side b"))
c=(a**2+b**2)**0.5
print("the length of c is:",c)
if c>pi:
    print("and is longer than pi")
